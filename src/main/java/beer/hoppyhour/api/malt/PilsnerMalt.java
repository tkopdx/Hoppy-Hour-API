    public static final String NOTES = "Pilsner malt or lager malt is the standard malt type used for most lager production. These malts are produced to retain maximum enzyme activity and to preserve certain sulfur-based flavor precursors characteristic of light-colored lagers. They produce less color and flavor than standard base malts and are very useful in producing beers in which other flavors and aromas are to be achieved. Traditionally, they are less modified than pale ale malt, as indicated by the harder kernels.";
